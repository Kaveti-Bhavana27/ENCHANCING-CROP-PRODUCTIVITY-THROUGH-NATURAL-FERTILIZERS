                <p>Organic fertilizers are made from natural materials like animal manure, compost, and bone meal, and are used to enrich soil and supply essential nutrients to plants. Unlike synthetic fertilizers, they do not contain harmful chemicals, making them a more environmentally friendly and sustainable option.</p>
                <p>One of the key benefits of organic fertilizers is their ability to improve soil structure and fertility over time. They release nutrients slowly, providing plants with a steady supply of essential elements like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. This slow release helps prevent nutrient burn and reduces the risk of leaching, which can harm the environment. Organic fertilizers also promote healthy soil by encouraging the growth of beneficial microorganisms, which further enhance plant health.</p>
                <p>There are three main types of organic fertilizers: animal-based (e.g., manure, bone meal), plant-based (e.g., seed meal, kelp), and mineral-based (e.g., rock phosphate). Each type offers different nutrients and benefits to plants. For example, manure is rich in nitrogen and improves soil structure, while bone meal is high in phosphorus and promotes root growth.</p>
                <p>Overall, organic fertilizers are a natural, sustainable way to nurture plants, improve soil health, and reduce environmental impact. They are a valuable option for anyone looking to cultivate healthy, thriving gardens or crops.</p>
